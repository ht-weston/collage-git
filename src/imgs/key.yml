#  Behavior
#  - Order of dirs determine order of output.
#  - This file stays synced with directory.  Captions and includes are preserved
#    despite syncing behavior.  Id's are updated as necessary to prevent
#    collisions.
#  - Shapefile matches id and what is included in this key.yml.
#  - Initial generation (or if key is missing) generates everything in the imgs
#    folder.
#
# Note: It might be easier to generate this key.yml, then using this to generate
# paths.  Ie editings the img class.
