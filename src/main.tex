\section*{Summary}

The purpose of the site visit is 
-   Conduct site visit to verify electrical components and as-built
    > conditions.

-   Establish the overall scope and components of the required upgrades
    > to be able to operate the treatment plant off of a portable
    > generator.

-   Determine estimated project cost.

During the site visit the Contractor
shall focus on verifying existing conditions including but not limited
to:

-   Is sufficient space available for the required upgrades?

-   Where would a portable generator be located and is there sufficient
    > space?

-   Will addition of the transfer switch require replacement of other
    > existing components to meet new code requirements?

-   Are other electrical upgrades recommended/required due to the age of
    > the electrical equipment?

The site visit must be coordinated one week in advance with the RTO.
-   Conduct site visit to verify well pump components and as-built
    > conditions.

-   Establish the overall scope and components of the required upgrades
    > to be able to operate the MV6 well pump at the 2,400 gpm pumping
    > target while achieving a combined flowrate of 4,800 gpm for the
    > treatment plant.

-   Determine estimated project cost.

by the RTO after contract award. During the site visit the Contractor
shall focus on verifying existing conditions including but not limited
to:

-   What is the extent of the required upgrades to accommodate a larger
    > pump motor?

-   Is sufficient space available for the required upgrades?

-   Are other electrical upgrades recommended/required due to the age of
    > the electrical equipment?

The site visit must be coordinated one week in advance with the RTO.

The purpose of this field visit is to visually inspect for utilities at each
site.  Each site was visited with photographs and notes were taken to document
the likely location of the underground utilities.  In the case the lateral lines
were to conflict with existing utilities, there may have a significant cost
associated with relocating the utility that may be cost prohibitive.
