\section*{Summary}
The purpose of this field visit was to support 1D and 2D hydrologic modeling.  The following items were investigated during the field visit:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Pictures and documentation of outlets, drains.
    \item Pictures and document surrounding topology.  Emphasis on upstream areas.
    \item Note soils conditions
    \item Note sensitive or priority equipment, elevations, foundations, etc.
\end{enumerate}

The operator, John Shimmin, reported that flooding at Big Bear Area Regional Wastewater Agency (BBARWA) wastewater treatment plant is unlikely.  BBARWA was constructed between 15-20 feet above the flood plain (Baldwin Lake). The geology of site consists of a clay layer that prevents most water from infiltrating.

Mr. Shimmin also reported that drains rarely discharge from the BBARWA.  Identified outlets were generally not maintained.  See the attached Site Map for more information.

Visible cracking of the clay layer was observed attesting to the clayey soils.  For the purposes of 2D modeling, the immediate area would likely experience very little infiltration.  The gentle grade of Baldwin Lake will likely experience little scouring as also shown in the attached photos.

The expansive nature of the clay layer may provide challenges to foundation design of the solar development.
